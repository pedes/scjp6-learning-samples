This project contains some SCJP-6 exam code snippets.

## Description ##

This is the project, which contains samples created by me while learning **1Z0-851 Java Standard Edition 6 Programmer** exam (former SCJP 6). If you're preparing for the exam, you can checkout and browse the code to see a lot of small programs that cover various areas expected on the test.

Project is divided into several packages:

  * net.mgorski.scjp.book - contains examples created while reading great book - “SCJP Sun Certified Programmer for Java 6 Study Guide (Exam 310-065)” by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates () which I highly recommend.
  * net.mgorski.scjp.test.. - contains various examples made while doing a lot of online testing (CertPal, SCJP Test Killer, and others)
  * net.mgorski.scjp.performance - contains various performance-related tests, which you'll not need for the exam

In the current version, non-compilable code has been commented out.
